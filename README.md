# TrueFormTSFE

A **React Native TypeScript Frontend Application** powered by Expo and React Navigation. This project delivers a smooth mobile and web experience with type safety and modern tooling.

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

This project uses **React Native**, **TypeScript**, and **Expo** for rapid development and cross-platform deployment.

### ✅ Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v14 or newer recommended)
- npm (comes with Node.js)
- [Expo CLI](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/expo-cli/) (optional, but helpful)

---

## 📦 Installation

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/EvolveU-FSD/c14-p3-true-form-backend
```

Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

---

## ▶️ Running the Application

```bash
npx expo start
```

This will launch the app.
Then you have to have an android emulator installed and started then press option 'a' to run it in the emulator

Install 'android studio' to install an emulator.
Or some ios version might work too.

To start emulator automatically by pressing 'a' after 'npx expo start' you need to add the android sdk to path. These two folders are key. Usually found in: (after android studio installation)

C:\Users\<YourUsername>\AppData\Local\Android\Sdk\emulator
C:\Users\<YourUsername>\AppData\Local\Android\Sdk\platform-tools

- ✅ **TypeScript** support for safer and cleaner code
- 🔄 **React Navigation** for intuitive routing
- 📱 **Expo** for cross-platform development
- 🌐 **Web support** for easier debugging and testing

## 🛠 Development Commands

- `npm run android` - Run the app on an Android emulator or connected device
- `npm run ios` - Run the app on an iOS simulator or connected device
- `npm run dev` - Run the app in an Expo tunnel that can be accessed from the outside world. Join from your local Expo Go app.

---

## 🌐 Testing with Ngrok Tunnel

To test the app on physical devices while running your backend locally, you'll need to set up an ngrok tunnel.

### Setting up Ngrok on Windows

1. Download and install ngrok from the official website:

   - Visit [https://ngrok.com/download](https://ngrok.com/download)
   - Download the Windows version
   - Extract the ngrok.exe file
   - Add ngrok to your Windows PATH or move it to a location like `C:\Windows`

2. Open Command Prompt (cmd.exe) - **Note: Do not use Git Bash**:
   ```cmd
   # Start your backend server first (default port 3000)
   # Then in a new CMD window, run:
   ngrok http https://localhost:3000
   ```
3. Once ngrok is running, find the "Forwarding" line.

- It will be in the format of {long url} -> https://localhost:3000
- Copy the {long url}, and use it as the `EXPO_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL` value in your .env file.
